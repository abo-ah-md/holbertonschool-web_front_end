# Techium HTML Advanced Project

Welcome!  
This project teaches you how to structure web pages with HTML tags‚Äî**no CSS, no styling**‚Äîso the final page may look ‚Äúugly‚Äù (that‚Äôs expected!). The focus is on learning to use HTML markup and develop good coding habits.

**Important Note:**  
Details matter! Be careful with lowercase vs uppercase and letter placement.

## üìö Resources

- HTML 5.2
- HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN
- HTML Reference - A free guide to all HTML elements and attributes
- Can I use‚Ä¶ Support tables for HTML5, CSS3, etc
- HTML Cheat Sheet - WebsiteSetup

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- State the main guidelines for writing HTML
- Create the skeleton of an HTML5 page
- Use semantic HTML tags to structure a web page
- Distinguish when to use `<div>` vs `<span>`
- Use and explain the semantic meanings of:
  - `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`
- Apply correct headings and follow hierarchical order
- Make lists in HTML (unordered, ordered, definition)
- Explain differences between media formats (SVG, GIF, PNG, JPG)
- Structure tabular data using `<table>`
- Integrate video & audio files on web pages
- Embed external content (e.g., iframe)
- Properly structure your HTML pages for accessibility and clarity

---

## üìù Requirements

- **A `README.md` file** must exist at the root of your project folder.
- Code should be W3C compliant and validate with [W3C-Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
- "Techium" is the company name to use throughout your webpages.

---

## üó∫ Sitemap & Wireframes

Your project will follow a full sitemap and wireframes (see intranet/task specifications for visual references).

---

## üìÇ File Structure

- All work is inside `/html_advanced` and related `/images`
- Example filenames: `0-index.html`, `article.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, `styleguide.html`, `index.html`, etc.

---

## üö© Task Highlights

- Start with a boilerplate HTML document (`<!DOCTYPE html> ... <html lang="en" dir="ltr">`)
- Successively add structure:
  - `<head>` with meta tags (charset, viewport, description, favicons)
  - `<body>` including `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`
  - Semantic tags and comments for easy code scanning
  - Add navigation, headings, lists, articles, blockquotes, images, social media links (using SVG icons), forms, video, audio, and iframe examples
- Organize sections and articles for "Services", "Works", "About Us", "Latest News", "Testimonials", "Contact"
- Build a full styleguide with all provided HTML elements, examples, and correct semantics

## ‚úÖ Milestone Tasks Overview

Below are some **representative milestone tasks** from the project sequence:

1. **Create your first HTML page:**  
   Minimal boilerplate (`0-index.html`)

2. **Structure your webpage:**  
   Add `<head>` and `<body>` (`1-index.html`)

3. **Meta tags & favicons:**  
   Character set, responsive viewport, title, description, favicon links (`2-index.html`)

4. **Add header, main, footer:**  
   Basic structure blocks (`3-index.html`)

5. **Semantic sections:**  
   Add section tags for hero, services, works, etc. (`5-index.html`)

6. **Articles for content:**  
   Nested `<article>` tags for works, news, testimonials (`6-index.html`)

7. **Navigation & links:**  
   Nav bar, anchor links, social icons, lists for navigation and footer

8. **Headings:**  
   Use all levels (`<h1>`-`<h6>`), following semantic hierarchy in different sections

9. **Paragraphs & Quotes:**  
   Insert paragraphs, blockquotes, cite authors

10. **Lists:**  
    Unordered, ordered, definition lists in styleguide

11. **Tables:**  
    Example with `<th>` scope attributes

12. **Media Integration:**  
    Add video, audio, images (with alt text, width, height as specified)

13. **Details & Iframe:**  
    Collapsible details, embedded videos

14. **Finalize with styleguide & index:**  
    Every tag and pattern demonstrated in `styleguide.html` and final `index.html` with SVG icons

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

- Always use semantic HTML‚Äîthey improve accessibility and maintainability.
- Pay careful attention to tag names, casing, and structure (as per requirements).
- Use comments and sectioning for clear code organization.
- Always include `alt` attributes for images and accessibility features for media.
- Refer to styleguide for examples of every tag/element required.
